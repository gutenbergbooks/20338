<h2>YULE-TIDE&mdash;OLD AND NEW.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">At the Commencement of the Century</span>.</h3>

<p>And they made merry in the good old
fashion. The pictures on the walls were
covered with holly and mistletoe. They had
come from British woods. Then the tables
groaned with Christmas cheer. The baron
of beef was flanked with plum-pudding and
mince-pies. There never was a more jovial
crew. The compliments of the season were
passed round, and the Christmas Waits,
singing their Christmas carols, were entertained
right royally. For was it not a time
of peace and good will? Then there was a
mighty laugh. A huge joke had been perpetrated.
Grandfather had been asleep, and
he was telling the youngsters, who had been
playing a round game, the character of his
dream.</p>

<p>"I give you my word it is true," said the
old man. "Yes, I actually forgot it was
Christmas!"</p>

<p>"But it was only in your dreams, Grandpapa,"
urged one of his descendants.</p>

<p>"Yes, but that was bad enough," cried the
old man in a tone of self-reproach, "fancy
forgetting Christmas&mdash;even in one's dreams!
Everything seems changing nowadays!"</p>

<p>But the Grandfather was wrong&mdash;the
Christmas bills were unchangeable. And
ever will be!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">At the End of the Century</span>.</h3>

<p>And certainly it was dull enough in all
conscience. Nowadays everything is dull.
Although it was towards the end of December,
the room was decorated with summer
flowers. They had come from Algeria. Then
the side-table was spread with a <i>recherch&eacute;</i>
repast, for they were all going to dine <i>&agrave; la
Russe</i>. But the guests were sad and thoroughly
bored. They had sent a policeman
after the itinerant street-musicians, with
the desired result. Inside and outside silence
reigned triumphant. Was it not a time for
"moving on" and threatening "six weeks
without the option of a fine"?</p>

<p>Then there was a deep groan. A young
man&mdash;somebody's Grandson&mdash;suggested a
round game. At first the suggestion was
received with derision.</p>

<p>"You can't get up a Missing Word Competition,"
said one. "No, my Grandson, you
can't."</p>

<p>"Can't I?" said the youngster, who had
been called 'Grandson.' "Can't I? Look
here, I will write out a Word, and I will bet
you none of you will guess it."</p>

<p>And "Grandson" wrote out a Word on a
piece of paper, and sealed it in a packet.
Then he called out the sentence, "The present
season of the year is known as&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then they all tried to guess it. Some one
said "unfavourable," another "pleasant," a
third "dreary," and a fourth "troublesome."</p>

<p>But they all were wrong.</p>

<p>At last the sealed-up packet was produced,
and opened. For the first time there was a
smile when the Word was known.</p>

<p>"Who would have thought of it?" was
the cry.</p>

<p>The word chosen was "Christmas."</p>

<p>"Fancy anyone remembering Christmas!
Even for a Missing Word Competition!
Everything seems changing nowadays!"</p>

<p>But the Grandson was wrong&mdash;his Christmas
bills were unchangeable. And ever will be!</p>

<h2>THE LAST WORD</h2>

<h3>(<i>A Domestic Drama of the Day before Yesterday.</i>)</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>.&mdash;<i>The Breakfast Room at Linoleum Lodge, the suburban
residence of</i> <span class="smcap">Samuel Stodgeford</span>, Esq. Mr. <i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Stodgeford</span>,
<i>their son</i> <span class="smcap">Parmenas</span>, <i>and daughters</i> <span class="smcap">Pompilia</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Priscilla</span>,
<i>discovered at breakfast.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Stodgeford.</i> We shall probably get it by the second post, and
though the delay is&mdash;ah&mdash;to some extent, annoying, we must not
allow ourselves to be unduly impatient. Personally, I regard these&mdash;ah&mdash;weekly
competitions as chiefly valuable in providing an
innocent form of domestic recreation, and an interesting example of
the&mdash;ah&mdash;value of words.</p>

<p><i>Parmenas S.</i> The value of <i>one</i> word, I should say, Father. Last
week, as there were very few who guessed right, it amounted to a
considerable sum.</p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> That is a stimulant to ingenuity, no doubt, with some
minds, but let us put that aside. We feel some natural curiosity
to know whether we have selected the missing
adjective, and I see no reason myself to doubt
that our united efforts will this time be
crowned with success.</p>

<p><i>Pompilia.</i> It is almost impossible that it
won't be <i>one</i> of the two hundred and fifty
we sent in.</p>

<p><i>Parmenas.</i> I drew up a list of synonyms
which, I flatter myself, was practically exhaustive.</p>

<p><i>Priscilla.</i> I dreamt I heard a voice saying
quite clearly in my ear, "Nonsensical! nonsensical!"&mdash;like
that&mdash;so I sent it in the
first thing next morning.</p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> These&mdash;ah&mdash;supernatural monitions
are not vouchsafed to us without a purpose.
It <i>may</i> be "nonsensical."</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> The only two words <i>I</i> could think
of were, "absurd" and "idiotic," and I'm
afraid they haven't much chance.</p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> I wouldn't say that, <span class="smcap">Sophronia</span>.
It is not always the most appropriate epithet
that&mdash;let me run over the paragraph again&mdash;where
is last week's paper? Ah, I have it.
(<i>He procures it and reads with unction.</i>)
"The lark, as has been frequently observed
by the poets, is in the habit of ascending to
high altitudes in the exercise of his vocal
functions. Scientific meteorologists, it is
true, do not consider that there is any immediate
danger of a descent of the sky, but
many bird-catchers of experience are of
opinion that, should such a contingency
happen, the number of these feathered songsters
included in the catastrophe would, in
all probability, be simply&mdash;&mdash;" It might be
"idiotic," of course, but I fancy "incalculable,"
or "appalling" would be nearer
the mark.</p>

<p><i>Parmenas.</i> Too obvious, <i>I</i> should say. If
you had adopted a few more of the words I
got from <i>Roget's Thesaurus</i>, we should have
been safer. Sending in a word like "disgusting"
was sheer waste of one-and-twopence!
And as for <span class="smcap">Pompilia</span>, with her synonyms to "sensational," and
<span class="smcap">Priscilla</span>, with her rubbishy superstition, depend upon it, <i>they</i>'re
no good!</p>

<p><i>Pompilia.</i> You think you know so much, because you've been
to London University&mdash;but <i>we've</i> been to a High School; so we're
not absolute <i>idiots</i>. <span class="smcap">Parmenas</span>!</p>

<p><i>Priscilla.</i> And I'm sure people have dreamt which horse was
going to win a race over and over again!</p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> Come, come, let us have none of these unseemly disputes!
And, when you compare a literary competition with&mdash;ah&mdash;a mere
gambling transaction, <span class="smcap">Priscilla</span>, you do a grave injustice to us all.
You forget that we have, all of us, worked hard for success; we
have given our whole thoughts and time to the subject. I have
stayed at home from the office day after day. Your mother has
had no leisure for the cares of the household; your brother has suspended
his studies for his approaching examination, and your elder
sister her labours at the East End&mdash;on purpose to devote our combined
intelligence to the subject. And are we to be told that we
are no better than the brainless multitude who speculate on horse-racing!
I am not <i>angry</i>, my child, I am only&mdash;(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Robert</span>,
<i>the</i> Page, <i>with a paper in a postal wrapper.) Tiddler's Miscellany</i>&mdash;ha,
at last! Why didn't you bring it up before, Sir? You must

<p><i>Mr. S. (ignoring their anxiety).</i> If you sent in nothing, Sir, so
much the better. But, in case you should be
tempted to such a piece of infatuation in
future, let me tell you this by way of&mdash;ah&mdash;warning.
I and my family, have, with
every advantage that superior education and
abilities can bestow, sent in, after prolonged
and careful deliberation, no less than two
hundred and fifty separate solutions, and not
a single one of these solutions, Sir, proves to

will read you the sentence as completed.

the number of these feathered songsters
included in the catastrophe would, in all probability,
be simply&mdash;ah&mdash;<i>nought</i>!" Now I venture to assert
that nothing short of&mdash;ah&mdash;absolute genius could possibly&mdash;&mdash;
(<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Robert</span>.) What do you mean by interrupting
me, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Robert.</i> Please, Sir, <i>I</i> said nothink, Sir!</p>

<p><i>Pompilia.</i> Oh, what <i>does</i> it matter? Give me the
paper, Papa. <i>(She snatches it.)</i> Oh, listen to this:&mdash;"The
number of solutions sent in was five hundred
thousand, which means that twenty-five thousand
pounds remain for division. The only competitor who
gave the correct solution was Mr. <span class="smcap">Robert Conkling</span>,
of Linoleum Lodge, Camberwell...." <i>Oh!</i> Why,
that's <i>you</i>, <span class="smcap">Robert</span>!</p>

<p><i>Robert.</i> Yes, Miss, I told you I said "Nothink,"
Miss. I'm sure if I'd thought&mdash;&mdash;</p>

Ah, <span class="smcap">Robert</span>, I trust you will not forget that this
piece of&mdash;ah&mdash;unmerited good fortune was acquired
by you under this humble roof. Shake hands, my
boy!</p>

<p><i>Pompilia.</i> Wait, Papa&mdash;don't shake hands till I've
done&mdash;<i>(continuing)&mdash;</i>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Conkling</span>, however, having
elected to disregard our conditions, requiring the
solution to be written out in full, and to express the
word "Nought" by a cipher, we cannot consider him
legally entitled to the prize&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> How dare you use my private address for your illiterate
attempts, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Prisc. (seizing the paper).</i> Why don't you read it all?&mdash;&mdash;"We
are prepared, nevertheless, to waive this informality, and a
cheque for the full amount of twenty-five thousand pounds,
payable to his order, will be forwarded to Mr. <span class="smcap">CONKLING</span> accordingly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> Well, <span class="smcap">Robert</span>, you deserve it, I must say&mdash;shake
hands!&mdash;I&mdash;ah&mdash;<i>mean</i> it.</p>

<p><i>Robert.</i> Thankee, Sir, I'm sure&mdash;it was Cook and <span class="smcap">Jane</span> 'elped me,

<h2>MONTECARLOTTERY.</h2>


<blockquote class="note">[It remains true that for those who want a brief
and exhilarating change, and are glad to reap for
the nonce the harvest of a quiet eye, there are
spots within the borders of England which, both in
climate and in scenery, can vie with the proudest
and most vaunted watering-places of the Sunny
South.&mdash;<i>Daily Paper</i>.]</blockquote>

<p><i>Damon on the Riviera, to Pythias at
Torquay.</i>&mdash;"Here I am, by the blue Mediterranean!
At least, the attendant of the sleeping-car
says the Mediterranean is somewhere
about, only, as a violent rain-storm is going
on, we can't see it. Very tired by journey.
Feel that, after all, you were probably right
in deciding to try the coast of Devonshire
this winter, instead of Riviera."</p>

<p><i>Pythias at Torquay, to Damon at Nice.</i>&mdash;"Coast
of Devonshire delightful, so far.
Pleasant run down from London by G. W. R.&mdash;only
five hours. Thought of and pitied
your crossing to Calais, and long night-and-day
journey after. You should just see our
geraniums and fuchsias, growing out-of-doors
in winter! Mind and tell me in your
next how the olives and orange-trees look."</p>

<p><i>Damon to Pythias.</i>&mdash;"Olives all diseased&mdash;have
not seen an orange-tree yet&mdash;there is
my reply to the query in your last. Hitherto
I have not had much opportunity of seeing
anything, as the mistral has been blowing,
and it has been rather colder than England
in March. Wretched cold in my head. No
decent fires&mdash;only pine-cones and logs to
burn, instead of coal! Wish I were at
Torquay with you!"</p>

<p><i>Pythias to Damon.</i>&mdash;"Sorry to hear that
Riviera is such a failure. More pleased than
ever with Devonshire. Glorious warm sunshine
to-day. Natives say they hardly ever
have frost. Children digging on sand on
Christmas Eve&mdash;too hot for great-coat. Rain
comes down occasionally, but then it dries up
in no time. Quite a little Earthly Paradise.
Glad I found it out."</p>

<p><i>Later from Damon.</i>&mdash;"Riviera better.
Mistral gone. Sun warm, and have seen my
first orange-tree. Have also found that
there's a place called Monte Carlo near Nice.
Have you ever heard of it? There's a
Casino there, where they have free concerts.
Off there now!"</p>

<p><i>Later from Pythias.</i>&mdash;"After all, Devonshire
<i>is</i> sometimes a little damp. Yes, I <i>have</i>
heard of Monte Carlo Casino, and I wish there
was anything of the sort at Torquay. Walks
and drives pretty, but monotonous. Hills
annoying. Still, evidently far superior to any
part of Riviera."</p>

<p><i>Still later from Damon.</i>&mdash;"Glorious place,
Monte Carlo. Superb grounds! Scenery
lovely, and Casinery still lovelier! And,
between ourselves, I have already more than
paid for expenses of my trip by my winnings
at the Tables. No time for more just now.
Must back the red!"</p>

<p><i>Reply to above from Pythias.</i>&mdash;"Very sorry
to hear you have been playing at the Tables.
Sure to end in ruin. By the bye, what system
do you use? The subject interests me merely
as a mathematical problem, of course. Wish
<i>I</i> could pay expenses of my Devonshire
hotel so easily. But then one ought to have
<i>some</i> reward for visiting such a dreary place
as the Riviera, with its Mistrals, and diseased
olive-trees, and all that."</p>

<p><i>Latest from Damon.</i>&mdash;"Since writing my
last letter, my views of the Riviera have
altered. The climate, I find, does not suit me.
Sun doesn't shine as much as I expected&mdash;not
at night, for instance. Then the existence
of an olive disease anywhere near is naturally
very <i>d&eacute;go&ucirc;tant</i> (as they say here). And the
Casino at Monte Carlo is simply an organised
swindle. It ought to be put down! After
staking ten times in succession on "Zero,"
and doubling my stake each time, I was absolutely
cleared out! Only just enough money
to take me home. Shall follow your example,
and try Torquay for the rest of the winter."</p>

<p><i>Latest from Pythias.</i>&mdash;"Just a hasty line
to say&mdash;<i>don't</i> come to Torquay! I am leaving
it. Since I last wrote, my views of Devonshire
have also altered. Can't conceal from
myself that the climate is a mistake. Damp,
dull, and depressing. Your account of Monte
Carlo&mdash;<i>not</i> the Casino, of course&mdash;so enchanting,
that I've determined to try it. Just off
to London to catch '<i>train de luxe!</i>'"</p>

<h2>MIXED NOTIONS.&mdash;No. II. UGANDA.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>As before, a Railway-carriage in a suburban morning train
to London. Persons also as before&mdash;namely, two</i> Well-informed
Men, <i>an</i> Inquirer, <i>and an</i> Average Man.</p>

<p><i>First Well-informed Man</i> (<i>laying down his paper</i>). So the
Government's going to stick to Uganda, after all. I had a notion,
from the beginning, they wouldn't be allowed to scuttle.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> Ah&mdash;I don't know that I'm particularly enthusiastic
about Uganda.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Why not?</p>

<p><i>A. M.</i> What are we going to get out of it?&mdash;that's the question.
We go interfering all over the world, grabbing here, and grabbing
there, merely in order to keep other people out; and then some
nigger King, with a cold in his head, sneezes as he passes the
Union Jack. That's an
insult to the flag, of
course; so off goes an
expedition, and, before
you know where you
are, we've spent about
ten millions, and added
a few thousand acres of
swamp to the Empire.
Why can't we leave
things alone? Haven't
we got enough?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> That's
all very well, I daresay;
but you forget that the
Berlin Conference made
Uganda one of our
spheres of influence.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> When was
that?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Why,
just after the Franco-Prussian
War. They
all met in Berlin to
settle up everything&mdash;and
we got Uganda.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> I thought
it was later than that,
somehow.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Well,
anyhow, it was somewhere
about that time.
I don't pledge myself to
a year or two. But what
I say about Uganda is
this. We're there&mdash;or
rather the Company is&mdash;and
we should simply
disgrace ourselves before
the whole world if
we chucked up the
sponge now. And, if
we did, we should have
France or Germany
nipping in directly.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i>
They can't.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Why
not?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i>
Why not! Because it's
our sphere of influence
whatever happens.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>timidly</i>). I'm afraid you'll think me very ignorant, but
I don't quite know what a "sphere of influence" is. I've read a lot
about it lately, but I can't quite make it out.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>condescendingly</i>). Yes, I know it's deuced
difficult to keep up with these new notions, unless you're in the
way of hearing all about them. Spheres of influence mean&mdash;well,
don't you know, they mean some country that's not quite yours, but
it's more yours than anybody else's, and if anybody else comes into
it, you're allowed to make a protocol of it. Besides, it gives you a
right to the Hinterland, you know.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>dubiously</i>). Ah, I see. What's the Hinterland?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>stumped</i>). I fancy it's about the most fertile
part of Africa. (<i>To First W. I. M.</i>) Isn't it?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Yes, that's it. It's the German for Highlands.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Of course, so it is. I might have thought of that.</p>

<p><i>Average Man</i> (<i>to First W. I. M.</i>). Seems to me you've none of
you got hold of the right point. What I want to know is, does
Uganda pay? <span class="smcap">Lugard</span> says it don't; the Company hasn't made
anything of it, and they've got to go whether they like it or not;
though I daresay they're deuced glad to be out of the hole. But,
if it don't pay, what on earth are we going to do with it?</p>

<p><i>Second W I. M.</i> (<i>triumphantly reinforcing him</i>). Yes, what on
earth are we to do with it?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>calmly, but contemptuously</i>). Ah! I see you're
both little-England men. From your point of view, I daresay
you're right enough. But I'm one of those who believe that we
must stick on wherever we've planted the flag. I agree with
<span class="smcap">Moltke</span>, that the nation that gives up is in a state of decay.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> It wasn't <span class="smcap">Moltke</span> who said that; it was <span class="smcap">Victor
Hugo</span>, or (<i>after a pause</i>) Lord <span class="smcap">Palmerston</span>.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Well, it doesn't matter who said it. The point is,
it's true. Besides, what are you going to do about the slaves and
the Missionaries?</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> Oh,
bother the Missionaries!</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> It's
all very well to say
"bother the Missionaries!"
but that won't
get you any further.
They're our fellow-creatures
after all, and
what's more, they're
our fellow-countrymen,
so we've got to look
after them.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> I
should let the whole lot
of Missionaries fight it
out together. They
only keep quarrelling
amongst themselves,
and trying to bag one
another's converts; and
then France and England
get involved.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> By the way,
where is Uganda, exactly?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Just
behind Zanzibar&mdash;or
somewhere about there.
You can get to it best
from Mashonaland.
Didn't you see that
<span class="smcap">Rhodes</span> said he was
going to make a telegraph-line
through
there? It used to belong
to the <span class="smcap">Sultan of
Zanzibar</span>. Don't you
remember?</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Of course;
so it did.</p>

<h2>CHOOSING CHRISTMAS TOYS.</h2>

<p>(<i>A Sketch in the Lowther Arcade.</i>)</p>


<p><i>Between the sloping banks of toys, and under a dense foliage of
coloured rosettes, calico banners, and Japanese-lanterns, the congested
Stream of Custom oozes slowly along, with an occasional
overflow into the backwaters of the shops behind, while the Stall-keepers
keep up a batrachian and almost automatic croak of
invitation.</i></p>

<p><i>Fond Grandmother</i>. So you've chosen a box of soldiers, have you,
<span class="smcap">Franky</span>?&mdash;very well.
Now what shall we get
for little <span class="smcap">Elsie</span> and Baby?</p>

<p><i>Franky (promptly).</i>
Another box of soldiers
would do nicely for <span class="smcap">Elsie</span>,
Grandmamma, and&mdash;<i>I</i>
know, a fort for Baby!</p>

<p><i>Grandm. (doubtfully).</i>
But they're such <i>little</i>
tots&mdash;they won't know
how to play with them.</p>

<p><i>Franky.</i> Oh, but I can
<i>teach</i> them, you know,
Grandmamma.</p>

<p><i>Grandm.</i> That's right&mdash;I
like to see a boy kind
to his little sisters.</p>

<p>[<i>She adopts</i> Master
<span class="smcap">Franky's</span> <i>disinterested
suggestion.</i></p>

<p><i>A Mother.</i> Now,
<span class="smcap">Percy</span>, it's all nonsense&mdash;you
<i>can't</i> want any
more toys&mdash;those you've
got are as good as new.
(<i>To her Friend</i>.) He's
such a boy for taking care
of his things&mdash;he'll hardly
trust his toys out of their
boxes, and won't allow
anyone else to <i>touch</i> them!</p>

<p><i>The Friend.</i> Dear little
fellow&mdash;then I'm sure he
<i>deserves</i> to be given a new
toy for being so careful!</p>

<p><i>The Mother.</i> Well,
he'll give me no peace
till I <i>do</i> give him something.
I know&mdash;but mind
this, <span class="smcap">Percy</span>, it's only to
keep you quiet, and I'm
not going to buy <span class="smcap">Eddie</span>
anything. <i>(To Friend.)</i>
He gives all <i>his</i> things
away as it is!
[Master <span class="smcap">Percy</span> <i>takes both
these valuable moral
lessons to heart</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Stilton (to her less
prosperous Sister-in-law</i>,
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bloomold</span>). Nonsense,
<span class="smcap">Vinnie</span>, I won't
<i>hear</i> of it! <span class="smcap">Reggie</span> has
more toys already than he
knows what to do with!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bloom. (apologetically).</i>
Of course, my
dear <span class="smcap">Sophia</span>, I know
your children are born
to every&mdash;&mdash;but still, I
have no one but myself
<i>now</i>, you know&mdash;and if I
<i>might</i>&mdash;it would be such
a <i>pleasure</i>!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Stilton.</i> I have
already told you there is not the slightest occasion for your spending
your money in any such foolish manner. I hope that is enough.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bloom.</i> I'm sure he would like one of these little water-carts&mdash;now
<i>wouldn't</i> you, <span class="smcap">Reggie</span>? [<span class="smcap">Reggie</span> <i>assents shyly</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Stilton.</i> Buy him one, by all means&mdash;he will probably take
the colour out of my new carpets with it&mdash;but, of course, <i>that</i>'s of
no consequence to <i>you</i>!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bloom.</i> Oh dear, I <i>quite</i> forgot your beautiful carpets. No,
to be sure, that might&mdash;&mdash;but one of those little butcher's shops,
now!&mdash;they're really <i>quite</i> cheap!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> <i>I</i> always thought cheapness was a question of what a
person could <i>afford</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bloom.</i> But I <i>can</i> afford it, dear <span class="smcap">Sophia</span>&mdash;thanks to dear
<span class="smcap">John's</span> bounty, and&mdash;and <i>yours</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> You mustn't thank <i>me</i>. <i>I</i> had nothing to do with it. I
warned <span class="smcap">John</span> at the time that it would only&mdash;&mdash;and it seems I was
right. And <span class="smcap">Reggie</span> has a butcher's shop&mdash;a really good one&mdash;already.
In fact, I couldn't tell you what he <i>hasn't</i> got!</p>

<p><i>Reggie.</i> <i>I</i> can, though, Aunt <span class="smcap">Vinnie</span>. I haven't got a train, for
<i>one</i> thing! (<i>To his Mother, as she drags him on</i>.) I <i>should</i> like a
little tin train, to go by
clockwork on rails so.
Do let Auntie&mdash;&mdash;what's
she staying behind for?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Bloom. (catching
them up, and thrusting a
box into</i> <span class="smcap">Reggie's</span> <i>hands).</i>
There, dear boy, there's
your train&mdash;with Aunt
<span class="smcap">Vinnie's</span> love! (<span class="smcap">Reggie</span>
<i>opens the box, and discovers
a wooden train</i>.)
What's the matter, darling?
Isn't it&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> He had rather
set his heart on a clockwork
one with rails&mdash;which
I was thinking of
getting for him&mdash;but I
am sure he's very much
obliged to his Aunt all
the same&mdash;<i>aren't</i> you,
<span class="smcap">Reginald</span>?</p>

<p><i>Reggie (with a fortunate
inspiration).</i> Thank
you <i>ever</i> so much, Auntie!
And I like this train
better than a tin one&mdash;because
all the doors open
really&mdash;it's <i>exactly</i> what
I wanted!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. S.</i> That's so like
<span class="smcap">Reggie</span>&mdash;he never says
anything to hurt people's
feelings if he can possibly
help it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B. (with meek
ambiguity).</i> Ah, dear
<span class="smcap">Sophia</span>, you set him such
an <i>example</i>, you see!
(<span class="smcap">Reggie</span> <i>wonders why she
squeezes his hand so</i>.)</p>

<p><i>A Vague Man (to Saleswoman).</i>
Er&mdash;I want a
toy of some sort&mdash;for a
<i>child</i>, don't you know.
(<i>As if he might require
it for an elderly person.</i>)
At least, it's not <i>exactly</i>
a child&mdash;it can <i>talk</i>, and
all that.</p>

<h3>"Er&mdash;I want a Toy of some sort&mdash;for a <i>Child</i>, don't you know!"</h3>
</div>


<p><i>Salesw.</i> Will you step
inside, Sir? We've a
large assortment within
to select from. Is it for
a boy or a girl?</p>

<p><i>The Vague Man.</i> It's
a boy&mdash;that is, its name's
<span class="smcap">Evelyn</span>&mdash;of course,
that's a girl's name too;
but it had better be some
thing that doesn't&mdash;I
mean something it
can't&mdash;&mdash;
[<i>He runs down.</i></p>

<p><i>Salesw.</i> I <i>quite</i> understand,
Sir. One of these little 'orses and carts are a very nice
present for a child&mdash;(<i>with languid commendation</i>)&mdash;the little 'orse
takes out and all.</p>

<p><i>The V. M.</i> Um&mdash;yes&mdash;but I want something more&mdash;a different
<i>kind</i> of thing altogether.</p>

<p><i>Salesw.</i> We sell a great many of these rag-dolls; all the clothes
take off and on.</p>

<p><i>The V. M.</i> Isn't that rather&mdash;&mdash;and then, for a boy, eh?</p>

<p><i>Salesw.</i> P'raps a box of wooden soldiers <i>would</i> be a more suitable
toy for a boy, certainly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The V. M.</i> Soldiers, eh?&mdash;yes&mdash;but you see, it might turn out to
be a girl after all&mdash;and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Salesw.</i> I see, you want something that would do equally well for
either. <i>Here</i>'s a toy now. (<i>She brings out a team of little tin swans on
wheels.</i>) You fix a stick in the end&mdash;so&mdash;and wheel it in front of
you, and all the little swans go up and down.</p>

<p>[<i>She wheels it up and down without enthusiasm.</i></p>

<p><i>The V. M. (inspecting it feebly).</i> Oh&mdash;the swans go up and down,
eh? It isn't quite&mdash;but very likely it won't&mdash;May as well have that
as something else&mdash;Yes, you can send it to&mdash;let me see&mdash;is it Hampstead
or Notting Hill they're living at now? (<i>To the</i> Saleswoman, <i>who
naturally cannot assist him.</i>) No, of course, <i>you</i> wouldn't know.
Never mind, I'll take it with me&mdash;don't trouble to wrap it up!</p>

<p>[<i>He carries it off&mdash;to forget it promptly in a hansom.</i></p>

<p><i>A Genial Uncle (entering with Nephews and Nieces).</i> Plenty to
choose from here, eh? Look about and see what you'd like best.</p>

<p><i>Jane (the eldest, sixteen, and "quite a little woman").</i> I'm sure
they would much rather <i>you</i> chose for them, Uncle!</p>

<p><i>Uncle</i>. Bless me, <i>I</i> don't know what boys and girls like nowadays&mdash;they
must choose for themselves!</p>

<p><i>Salesw. (wearily).</i> Perhaps one of the young gentlemen would like
a dredging-machine? The handle turns, you see, and all the little
buckets go round the chain and take up sand or mud&mdash;or there's a
fire-engine, <i>that's</i> a nice toy, throws a stream of real water.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, <i>aged eleven, is charmed with the dredging-machine,
while the fire-engine finds favour in the eyes of</i> <span class="smcap">Bobby</span>,
<i>aged nine.</i></p>

<p><i>Jane (thoughtfully).</i> I'm afraid the dredging-machine is rather a
<i>messy</i> toy, Uncle, and the fire-engine wouldn't do at all, either&mdash;it
would be sure to encourage them to play with fire. <span class="smcap">Bobby</span>, if you
say "blow!" once more, I shall tell Mother. Uncle is the best
judge of what's suitable for you!</p>

<p><i>Uncle.</i> Well, there's something in what you say, <span class="smcap">Jenny</span>. We
must see if we can't find something better, that's all.</p>

<p><i>Salesw.</i> I've a little Toy-stige, 'ere&mdash;with scenes and characters
in "<i>Richard Cured o' Lyin'</i>" complete and ready for acting&mdash;how
would that do?</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Tommy</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Bobby</span> <i>cheer up visibly at this suggestion.</i></p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> I <i>don't</i> think Mother would like them to have <i>that</i>, Uncle&mdash;it
might give them a <i>taste</i> for theatres, you know!</p>

<p><i>Uncle.</i> Ha&mdash;so it might&mdash;very thoughtful of you, <span class="smcap">Jane</span>&mdash;Mustn't
get in your Mother's bad books; never do! What's in these boxes?
soldiers? How about these, eh, boys? [<i>The boys are again consoled.</i></p>

<p><i>Jane (gently).</i> They're getting <i>rather</i> too big for such babyish
things as soldiers, Uncle! I tell you what <i>I</i> think&mdash;if you got a nice
puzzle-map for <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>&mdash;he's so backward in his Geography&mdash;and a
drawing slate for <span class="smcap">Bobby</span>, who's getting on so nicely with his drawing,
and a little work-box&mdash;not an <i>expensive</i> one, of course&mdash;for
<span class="smcap">Winnie</span>, that would be <i>quite</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>These sisterly counsels are rewarded by ungrateful and
rebellious roars.</i></p>

<p><i>Uncle.</i> <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, did I hear you address your sister as a "beast"?
Come&mdash;come! And what are you all turning on the waterworks for,
eh? Strikes me, <span class="smcap">Jane</span>, you haven't <i>quite</i> hit off their tastes!</p>

<p><i>Jane (virtuously).</i> I have only told you what I know Mother
would <i>wish</i> them to have, Uncle; and, even if I <i>am</i> to have my
ankles kicked for it, I'm sure I'm right!</p>

<p><i>Uncle.</i> Always a consolation, my dear <span class="smcap">Jenny</span>. I'm sure no
nephew of <i>mine</i> would kick his sister, except by the merest accident&mdash;so
let's say no more of that. But it's no use getting 'em
what they don't like; so suppose we stick to the fire-engine, and the
other concern&mdash;theatre is it, <span class="smcap">Johnny</span>?&mdash;Very well&mdash;and don't you
get <i>me</i> into trouble over 'em, that's all. And <span class="smcap">Winnie</span> would like a
doll, eh?&mdash;that's all right. Now everybody's provided for&mdash;except
<span class="smcap">Jane</span>!</p>

<p><i>Jane (frostily).</i> Thank you, Uncle&mdash;but you seem to forget I'm
not <i>exactly</i> a child! [<i>She walks out of the shop with dignity.</i></p>

<p><i>Uncle.</i> Hullo! Put my foot in it again! But we can't leave
<span class="smcap">Jenny</span> out of it&mdash;<i>can</i> we? Must get her a present of some sort over
the way.... Here, <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, my boy, you can tell me something
she'd like.</p>

<p><i>Bobby (later&mdash;to</i> <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>). What did you tell Uncle to get
for <span class="smcap">Jane</span>?</p>

<p><i>Tommy (with an unholy chuckle).</i> Why, a box with one of those
puff-things in it. Don't you know how we caught her powdering
her nose with Mother's? And Uncle <i>got</i> her one too! <i>Won't</i> she
be shirty just!</p>

notes:&mdash;first that Mr. C. <span class="smcap">Letts</span> describes some of his <i>Pocket
Diaries</i> as "The Improved." There is nothing so good but what it
could be better. Lett's admit this, and be satisfied with the latest edition
of Letts' Annuals, which are prizes, though, until Jan. 1, blanks.</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>The Paradise of the North</i>, by <span class="smcap">David Lawson Johnstone</span>. When
a gentleman chooses the North Pole as a Paradise, he must be allowed
any amount of Latitude and Longitude. This explorer leaves his
<span class="smcap">Chambers</span> (the Publishers of that ilk) in order to get out of the
world by the coldest route.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A note on <span class="smcap">Innes</span> &amp; Co. "Innes" has several Outs this season.
Cheery name for a Christmas Publisher, "Innes." We take our
ease at our Innes, and we read with pleasure their dainty books
called, <i>Bartlemy's Child</i>, by <span class="smcap">Frances Compton</span>, a very pretty story.
<span class="smcap">L. B. Walford</span> (the authoress of <i>Mr. Smith</i>) condescends to write
<i>For Grown-Up Children</i>, a number of delightful tales.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Messrs. <span class="smcap">Osgood</span> as good as ever. Why not follow up their <i>Bret
Harte Birthday Book</i> (most Harte-tistically got up) with a <i>Sweet-Heart
Birthday Book?</i> Madame <span class="smcap">Van de Velde</span> has compiled this.
Our sparklingest Baronite exclaims, "Velde done!"</blockquote>

<h3>The Baron and his Christmas Books.</h3>
</div>

<p>"A most sweet story! A most charming story!!" gurgled the Baron,
as, with sobs in his inner voice, talking to himself, he finished the
penultimate chapter of <i>Dolly</i>. "Now, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Burnett</span>, if you dare
to kill your heroine, I swear I'll never forgive you, and never read
another of your fatally-fascinating books." The Baron trembled as
he commenced the last chapter of the simplest, most natural, most
touching, and most exquisitely-told story he has read for many a
day. How would it end? A few lines sufficed. "Bless you, Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Burnett</span>!" snivelled the Baron, not ashamed of dabbing his eyes
with his kerchief. "Bless you, Ma'am! You have let 'em live!
May your new book go to countless editions! May it be another
<i>Little Lord Fauntleroy</i>, and may you reap a golden reward for
this, your masterpiece of simple work, your latest story&mdash;<i>Dolly!</i>"
The Baron is bound ("bound in morocco" as the slaves were, poor
wretches!) to add that he wishes it had not been illustrated, for,
as good wine needs no bush, so a perfect story, such as is this, needs
no illustration; nay, is rather injured by it than not. There is
only one small item of common-place in it, and that is making the
would-be seducer a married man. Of course, to prove him so was
the easiest and shortest way of saving his vain and feather-headed
little victim. Perhaps an alternative would have involved complication,
and might have marred the natural simplicity of the story.
So critically the Baron states his one very small objection, and
reverts with the utmost pleasure to the hours he spent over the tale,
absorbed in every page, in every line of it; and herewith doth he,
not only most strongly, but most earnestly recommend everyone to
procure this book (published by <span class="smcap">E. Warne</span> &amp; Co.), for it is one that can
be and must be given a place of honour by the side of <span class="smcap">Dickens</span> and
<span class="smcap">Thackeray</span>, to be read again and again, here a bit and there a bit,
when other works of fiction now enjoying a greater literary reputation
(though 'twould be difficult to name them), shall be relegated
to the lowest shelves of books that have had their day. "<i>Dixi!
Scripsi!</i>" quoth <span class="smcap">The Learned Baron de Book-worms</span>.</p>
